Data Source

The data for this analysis was collected from various reliable sources that provide information on start-ups in India and their funding rounds from 2018 to 2021. Due to privacy and legal considerations, the raw data cannot be provided directly in this repository. However, we will describe the data preprocessing steps and provide insights based on the analysis.
Tools Used

    Python: We used Python as the primary programming language for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib were utilized for these tasks.

Data Analysis

The data analysis is divided into the following steps:

    Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting descriptive statistical analysis, visualizations, and identifying key trends in the funding received by start-ups in India during the specified period.

    Insights and Recommendations: Based on the findings from the EDA, we will draw insights about the Indian start-up ecosystem and provide recommendations for our team's venture or any other interested parties.
