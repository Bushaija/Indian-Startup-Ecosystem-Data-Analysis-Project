#The Project analyses Funding Received by Start-ups in India from years 2018 - 2021.

## Project Description
This data analysis project focuses on the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. The objective is to gain insights into the Indian start-up ecosystem and propose the best course of action for our team's venture. By analyzing the data on funding amounts, start-up details, and investor information, we aim to unearth prevailing patterns and gain insights about the opportunities in India's start-up ecosystem to inform decision-making.

## The type of the problem
This project is of the exploratory data analytics and visualization type as it is our aim to deduce hidden insights and patterns from the available data.

## To guide our analysis, we have formulated 5 SMART questions:
1. What is the overall trend in funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021?
2. Which industries or sectors have received the highest funding during this period?
3. What is the distribution of startups across the cities in India?
4. What is the average funding amount received by start-ups in India during this period?
5. Is there a correlation between the funding amount and the number of investors involved in funding rounds?

## The following hypothesis were formulated for testing:
Hypothesis 1: <br>
```Null```: The funding received by start-ups in India has not demonstrated consistent upward trajectory over the years.<br>
```Alternate```: The funding received by start-ups in India has demonstrated a consistent upward trajectory over the years.

Hypothesis 2: <br>
```Null```: There are no significant disparities in funding received by all sectors of the Indian startups. <br>
```Alternate```: The technology sectors receive higher funding compared to other industries.

Hypothesis 3: <br>
```Null```: Situating a startup in a particular city does not influence funding.<br>
```Alternate```: Situating a startup in a particular city significantly affects funding.

### Hypothesis 4: <br>
```Null```: There are no significant disparities in funding received among different stages of the Indian startups. <br>
```Alternate```: During different stages the startups received different funding amounts.

## To test these hypotheses, we will conduct the following analyses: 
* For Hypothesis 1, analyze the year-by-year funding amounts and calculate the average growth rate of funding.
* To investigate Hypothesis 2, categorize start-ups based on industry and compare the funding amounts received by each sector.
* Regarding Hypothesis 3, examine the distribution of start-ups across cities and deduce which cities harbour most highly-funded start-ups.
* Regarding hypothesis 4, categorize start-ups based on stages and compare the funding amounts received by each stage.

## Conclusion
By rigorously examining the data and conducting these analyses, we will gain valuable insights into the start-up ecosystem in India. These insights will enable us to formulate informed recommendations and determine the optimal strategy for our team's venture.
